# Account Manager (Community Fork)

This is a **community-maintained fork** of the original
[Account-Manager](https://github.com/swiveI/Account-Manager) project.

# Technical Changes

As the original version went through different namespaces I went for a personal namespace and added a migration tool for older scripts.
It should be useable with the Namespace _4liceD.Utilities.AccountManager.
For old scripts please using the namespace migration tool under "Account Manager/Migrate Namespaces".

Account manager is a tool for converting spreadsheet data, via csv, into arrays for easy access by `Udonbehaviours` within VRChat.

This tool is designed to handle tracking player data via spreadsheets and bringing that data into VRChat. 
It is intended to be used by programmers to build other Udon scripts that work off of this data.
A common usage for example would be to track patreon supporters to grant access to perks within the world, 
or by adding them to a custom list you can easily update name displays within the world.

## Why this fork exists

This fork primarily exists for my own convenience so I can continue using and updating
the project with current VRChat Creator Companion builds.

I try to maintain it when I can, but I'm not a professional maintainer and I can't
promise fast updates or long-term support.

If this project helps you, great! If you find bugs or want to improve things,
pull requests and contributions are very welcome, but please understand this is
a best-effort community fork, not an officially supported product.
